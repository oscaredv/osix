# OSIX
`OSIX`, or Oscar's Unix-clone, is a simple operating system for the i386 platform. It only runs on the Qemu emulator, and has never been tested on real hardware. The sole purpose of OSIX is to be a learning experience for the author.

The long term goal, after writing a poorly designed imitation of Unix, is to rewrite parts of the system with new ideas and concepts.
